In this case, there are additional dimension descriptor datasets theta, theta\_dark, and theta\_white that contain the positions of the rotation axis for each projection, dark, and white image. The lefthand example shows this as it would appear using the HDF5 H5DSattach\_scale function. The righthand example shows this as it would appear by manually adding an axes attribute (for cases where H5DSattach\_scale is unavailable).\relax }}{7}{figure.caption.6}
